			<h2>Nutrition Q&A</h2>
			<div class="qa" onclick="toggleList('qa1')">1. If weight loss (and maintenance) really comes down to the
				matter of calories in versus calories out, can I reach my goal by staying under a certain amount of
				calories per day?</div>
			<div id="answer_qa1" class="answer_qa">
				<p>True, the most important factor for weight loss is burning more calories than you eat. But to
					ensure you're burning off body fat and not muscle—and to build muscle while burning body
					fat—your macronutrient intake becomes critical.
					<br><br> Since muscle is composed of protein, it makes sense that you need ample amounts of
					protein. So when trying to drop body fat, you don't want to lower protein intake.
					<br><br> We now know that eating fat does not lead to fat gain, especially when you eat the
					right
					kinds—namely, essential fats like the omega-3 and monounstaurated fats. In fact, these fats
					actually encourage fat loss.
					<br><br> Unlike protein and fat, which are essential, there are no essential carbs. That's
					because
					your body can convert protein and fat into carbs. So to lose fat you should start by reducing
					carb intake.
					<br><br>This method also helps to keep insulin levels low and steady, which allows for greater
					fat
					burning and less fat gain.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa" onclick="toggleList('qa2')">2. What combination of macronutrients should a healthy,
				active
				woman shoot for on a daily basis?</div>
			<div id="answer_qa2" class="answer_qa">
				<p>Typically we suggest about 1 to 1.5 g of protein, about 1 g of carbs or less, and about 0.25 to
					0.5 g of fat per pound of bodyweight.
					<br><br> That comes out to about 11-15 calories per pound of bodyweight.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa" onclick="toggleList('qa3')">3. Aside from protein, carbs and fat, what should I be
				looking
				at on nutrition labels as far as what to eat and what to avoid?</div>
			<div id="answer_qa3" class="answer_qa">
				<p>Most of the food you eat should be fresh, unpackaged food that doesn't necessarily have a
					nutrition label on it—fish, chicken, steak, eggs, veggies and fruit.
					<br><br> This, along with your supplements, is where your micronutrients, such as vitamins and
					minerals, will be coming from.
					<br><br>With packaged foods, focus on the major macros. Fiber is part of the carb macro, so the
					more fiber the better. And check that the sugar content is less than half the total carbs.
					<br><br> Also be sure that there are zero trans fats, as well as nothing as hydrogenated or
					partially hydrogentated—code words for trans fats.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa" onclick="toggleList('qa4')">4. What are the pros and cons of low-carb diets? </div>
			<div id="answer_qa4" class="answer_qa">
				<p>A lot of people complain they have no energy when eating low carb and have difficulty working
					out.
					<br><br> This is true during the first couple of weeks of being on a low-carb diet. That's
					because in those who have been eating higher carbs, their bodies have adapted to burning carbs
					as a primary fuel source.
					<br><br>When those ample carbs are suddenly gone, the body first struggles to burn adequate
					amounts of fat for fuel. However, after a few weeks of sticking with a low-carb diet, the body
					adapts by increasing the enzymes involved in burning fat, and becomes more efficient at burning
					fat for fuel.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa" onclick="toggleList('qa5')">5. If weight loss is predominantly about calories in versus
				calories out, isn't it better to skip meals if I’m not hungry? </div>
			<div id="answer_qa5" class="answer_qa">
				<p>Not really, as that can put your body in starvation mode, which slows your metabolism down and
					causes you to store more fat when you do eat.
				</p>
